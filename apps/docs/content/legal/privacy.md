# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: {{ $doc.lastUpdated }}**  
**Effective date: {{ $doc.effectiveDate }}**

This Privacy Policy describes how Finueva ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the Finueva platform, including our web application (app.finueva.com), and landing page (finueva.com)

## 1. Data Controller Information

**Data Controller**: Finueva
**Email**: contact@finueva.com
**Service**: Informer
**Website**: https://finueva.com  
**Application**: https://app.finueva.com

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Account and Authentication Data

When you create an account on Finueva, we collect and store your email address as your primary identifier and communication channel, along with your chosen username which must be unique across the platform. You can optionally provide a profile avatar, and we record which authentication method you used to create your account (OAuth, Google OAuth, or Email with one-time password).

We also maintain your user role for access control purposes, timestamps of when your account was created and last updated, your onboarding completion status, and whether you've used our command-line interface tool.

### 2.2 Authentication Tokens and Sessions

For access, we generate encrypted authentication tokens that you can create and manage through your account settings. Each token has a user-defined name for identification purposes, and we track when tokens are created and last used for security monitoring. These tokens follow the format `she_[user_id]_[random_string]`.

When you use OAuth authentication with a broker, we temporarily store the API keys or tokens in secure sessions to maintain your authentication state. For email-based authentication, we generate temporary one-time password codes that automatically expire after a short period for security purposes.

### 2.3 Project and Team Data

We store information about the teams and projects you create or participate in. For teams, this includes the team name, a URL-friendly unique identifier, optional custom team branding, and timestamps tracking when teams are created and updated.
